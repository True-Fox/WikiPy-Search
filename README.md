<h1>WikiPy-Search</h1>

<p>
 WikiPy-Search is a command line tool that lets you access the vast knowledge of wikipedia from your terminal. You can search for any topic and get a summary of the article.<br/>
  This project uses socket programming to create a server and client that communicate with each other. This way the search is faster and more efficient. The client sends a query to the server and the server return the summary of article back to the client.<br/>
  WikiPy-Search is an easy and fun tool for anyone who wants to learn something new.
